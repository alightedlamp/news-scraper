# MetaHacker

MetaHacker is an app which scrapes various programming and web development websites and lists current articles. Where applicable, articles will be given a score which is stored in the database.

Users can create an account using a PassportJS Local Strategy, through which they can save articles and links for later reference, leave comments on articles for other users to see, and mark an article as a favorite. Favorites are collected and listed on the homepage as a filter.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the websites whose data this scrapes; to [@verekia](https://github.com/verekia) from whose [JavaScript Stack From Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) tutorial I learned how to ES6ify my Node and implement some more 'clean code' principles.
